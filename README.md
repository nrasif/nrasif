## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ 
I am Nahari Rasif, a final year student at the Department of Geophysical Engineering, Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology, Surabaya. Even though I didn't major in data, I am very motivated and curious about big data and how it is implemented and used in the real world. Currently, I'm studying and deepening in the field of data analytics and a little bit in the field of machine learning. Because of my love for python programming, I'm writing guides and explanations about my projects on [Medium](https://medium.com/@naharirasif).

#### Here is my repository list by topic:

### Machine Learning Engineering
- [Simple Statistics and K-Nearest Neighborhood Imputer for Well Log Data](https://github.com/nrasif/KMeans-Imputation-WellLogs) - [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@naharirasif/imputing-missing-well-log-data-values-with-simple-statistics-and-knn-imputer-58c7343d3163)
- [Well Log Prediction using Gradient Boosting Algorithm (Thesis Work)](https://github.com/nrasif/DTlog-Prediction-MachineLearning-Thesis)

### Data Analytics
