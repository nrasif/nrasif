### Hello there! 👋 
I am Nahari Rasif, a final year student at the Department of Geophysics Engineering, Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology, Surabaya. Even though I didn't major in data, I am very motivated and curious about big data and how it is implemented and used in the real world. Right now, I'm studying and deepening in the field of data analytics and a little bit in the field of machine learning.
