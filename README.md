### Hello there! ğŸ‘‹ 
I am Nahari Rasif, a final year student at the Department of Geophysical Engineering, Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology, Surabaya. Even though I didn't major in data, I am very motivated and curious about big data and how it is implemented and used in the real world. Currently, I'm studying and deepening in the field of data analytics and a little bit in the field of machine learning.
